# MIDI Song Creation Tool - PR Splitting Plan

## Overview

We have divided the complex PR into three focused PRs, each addressing a specific concern:

1. **Project Structure**: Reorganizing the project into proper directories
2. **Testing Infrastructure**: Adding testing framework and tests
3. **Linting Configuration**: Adding code quality tools

## Branches Created

I've created the following branches from `feature/testing-suite`:

- `feature/project-structure`: Contains only project structure changes
- `feature/testing-suite-only`: Contains only testing infrastructure
- `feature/linting-only`: Contains only linting configuration

## Next Steps

### 1. Clean Up Each Branch

Each branch has a `CLEANUP_COMMANDS.md` file with instructions for removing files that don't belong in that branch. You'll need to:

```bash
git checkout feature/project-structure
# Follow instructions in CLEANUP_COMMANDS.md
# Then push the changes

git checkout feature/testing-suite-only
# Follow instructions in CLEANUP_COMMANDS.md
# Then push the changes

git checkout feature/linting-only
# Follow instructions in CLEANUP_COMMANDS.md
# Then push the changes
```

### 2. Create Pull Requests in Sequence

1. Create a PR for `feature/project-structure` into `develop`
   - Use the content from `PR_DESCRIPTION.md` as your PR description
   
2. Once that's merged, create a PR for `feature/testing-suite-only` into `develop`
   - Use the content from `PR_DESCRIPTION.md` as your PR description
   
3. Once that's merged, create a PR for `feature/linting-only` into `develop`
   - Use the content from `PR_DESCRIPTION.md` as your PR description

### 3. After All PRs are Merged

Once all three PRs are merged, you can delete the original `feature/testing-suite` branch, since all of its changes will have been incorporated into `develop` through the three focused PRs.

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Easier Reviews**: Each PR focuses on one specific concern
- **Reduced Conflicts**: Smaller, targeted changes reduce merge conflicts
- **Better Understanding**: Reviewers can understand the purpose of each change
- **Incremental Adoption**: Team can adapt to one change at a time
- **Clearer History**: Git history shows logical progression of changes

## Documentation

Each branch contains:
- Updated `README.md` explaining the specific focus of that branch
- `PR_DESCRIPTION.md` to use when creating the PR
- `CLEANUP_COMMANDS.md` with instructions for removing unrelated files
