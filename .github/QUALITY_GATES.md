# Quality Gates for MIDI Song Creation Tool

This document outlines the quality gates for the MIDI Song Creation Tool project and how to work with them.

## Overview of Quality Gates

Quality gates are automated checks that ensure code meets certain standards before it can be merged into important branches (like `main` or `develop`). They help maintain code quality, prevent regressions, and ensure consistent coding practices.

Our quality gates include:

1. **Linting checks** - Ensure code adheres to style guidelines
2. **Unit tests** - Verify individual functions and components work as expected
3. **Integration tests** - Test API endpoints and module interactions
4. **End-to-end tests** - Test full application workflows
5. **Code coverage** - Ensure sufficient test coverage

## GitHub Action Workflows

We have the following GitHub Action workflows:

1. **Lint (`lint.yml`)** - Runs ESLint and Prettier
2. **Test Suite (`test.yml`)** - Runs all tests and reports coverage

These workflows automatically run on pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches and directly on pushes to these branches.

## Phased Implementation Strategy

Given some initial setup challenges, we're implementing quality gates in phases:

### Phase 1: Core Module Validation
- Focus on linting `src/core` and `src/server` modules
- Run unit and integration tests
- Basic code coverage reporting

### Phase 2: React Component Validation
- Add linting for `src/client` components
- Enable JSX validation
- Improve code coverage thresholds

### Phase 3: Complete Testing Suite
- Enable E2E tests with Cypress
- Add Cypress ESLint plugin configuration
- Implement pre-commit hooks

### Phase 4: CI/CD Integration
- Add deployment workflows
- Release automation
- Comprehensive reporting

## Local Testing Strategy

The current local testing approach is designed to gradually introduce the quality gates. To run the tests:

```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x scripts/local_test.sh

# Run
./scripts/local_test.sh
```

This script currently:
- Runs ESLint on the `src/core` and `src/server` directories
- Runs Prettier checks on the same directories
- Runs unit and integration tests
- Checks test coverage
- Builds the project

## Fixing Linting Issues

To address linting issues effectively:

1. **Fix incrementally**:
   ```bash
   # Fix issues in one directory at a time
   npx eslint src/core --fix
   npx eslint src/server --fix
   ```

2. **Automate formatting**:
   ```bash
   # Format all files
   npm run format
   ```

3. **Tackle warnings first**:
   - Unused variables
   - Console statements that should be removed
   - Line length issues

## Future Improvements

As the project evolves, consider:

1. **Adding pre-commit hooks** to run linting/testing before commits
2. **Customizing ESLint rules** to better match project needs
3. **Improving test coverage thresholds** as the codebase matures
4. **Adding performance testing** for critical MIDI operations
