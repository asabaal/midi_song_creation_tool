# Testing Suite Branch - Cleanup Plan

I've analyzed the branch and identified the following files that need to be removed to focus only on testing infrastructure changes.

## Files to Remove

### Linting Files:
- `.eslintrc`
- `.eslintrc.js`
- `.eslintrc.json`
- `.prettierrc`

### Scripts to Remove:
- `scripts/fix_*` files
- `scripts/format-code.sh`

## Next Steps

Since GitHub's API doesn't allow directly deleting files through this interface, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository locally if you haven't already:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/asabaal/midi_song_creation_tool.git
cd midi_song_creation_tool
```

2. Checkout the testing-suite-only branch:
```bash
git checkout feature/testing-suite-only
```

3. Run the following commands to remove linting files:
```bash
# Remove linting files
git rm -f .eslintrc .eslintrc.js .eslintrc.json .prettierrc

# Remove related scripts
git rm -f scripts/fix_*
git rm -f scripts/format-code.sh
```

4. Commit the changes:
```bash
git commit -m "Remove linting files from testing-suite-only branch"
```

5. Push the changes:
```bash
git push origin feature/testing-suite-only
```

6. After the project-structure PR is merged, create a PR for the `feature/testing-suite-only` branch into `develop` using the description in PR_DESCRIPTION.md

Once you've completed this, let me know and we can proceed with implementing the final PR.
