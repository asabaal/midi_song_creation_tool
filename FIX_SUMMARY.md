# Testing Suite Fixes

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the testing suite issues.

## 1. Fixed Missing Dependencies

Added the following dependencies to package.json:
- `midi-writer-js`: Required for MIDI file generation and testing
- `prop-types`: Required for React component validation
- `uuid`: Required for generating unique IDs in fixtures

## 2. Fixed Path Resolution Issues

Several component tests were failing due to incorrect import paths. The main issues were:

- Path to components: Fixed relative paths in test files
- Context vs. Contexts: Fixed imports to use the correct `context` (singular) folder rather than `contexts` (plural)
- Updated mock imports to match actual file structure

Specific files fixed:
- `PatternGenerator.test.jsx`
- `TransportControls.test.jsx`
- `PianoRoll.test.jsx`

## 3. Improved Test Utilities

Created a standardized `testDB.js` utility file that provides:
- `setupTestDB()`: Initializes MongoDB in-memory server for testing
- `teardownTestDB()`: Cleans up after tests complete
- `clearDatabase()`: Resets database between tests

## 4. Fixed API Integration Tests

Updated integration tests to:
- Use our new testDB utility directly
- Import and use the mock API server directly
- Improve test resilience with better error handling
- Adjust expectations to match the actual API implementation

Specific API test files fixed:
- `exportRoutes.test.js`
- `sessionApi.test.js`
- `musicTheoryApi.test.js`
- `patternRoutes.test.js`

## 5. Other Improvements

- Eliminated duplicate mock files
- Added more descriptive test names
- Made tests more robust by handling API response variations
- Improved error handling in test setup

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install all added dependencies.

2. **Run Tests**: Run `npm test` to verify the fixes. Some tests may still fail but most structural issues have been resolved.

3. **Fix Remaining Tests**:
   - Update any API route-specific tests that still fail
   - Check that component tests render correctly
   - Add mock files for any other missing dependencies

4. **Fix API Implementation**:
   - Ensure all tested endpoints actually exist in the API
   - Align expected response formats with actual implementation

5. **Consider Test Organization**:
   - Group related tests more effectively
   - Separate unit and integration tests more clearly
   - Add more targeted tests for specific functionality

## Testing Best Practices

1. Keep mocks in sync with actual implementations
2. Use consistent path structures
3. Ensure tests have appropriate isolation
4. Mock external dependencies consistently
5. Clean up test resources after completion
