# MIDI Song Creation Tool - Functionality Fix Notes

## Overview of Changes

This document outlines the changes made to restore functionality in the project structure reorganization. 
The main issues were related to session handling, track/sequence synchronization, and API endpoint behavior.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Port Configuration**
   - Fixed the server port to consistently use 3003 as in the original code
   - Updated `src/server/server.js` to ensure the correct port configuration

2. **Session Handling & Track Synchronization**
   - Enhanced the Session model to properly synchronize between sequences and tracks
   - Added `_syncTrackWithSequence` helper method to ensure notes are properly reflected in UI
   - Updated all Session methods to maintain this synchronization automatically
   - Fixed Session.findById to ensure returned sessions have prototype methods

3. **Pattern Generation**
   - Fixed pattern generation to properly set channel values for proper UI display
   - Ensured bassline notes use channel 1 and drum notes use channel 9
   - Updated track metadata to correctly identify instrument types

4. **API Endpoint Consistency**
   - Fixed API endpoints to ensure consistent behavior between API-prefixed and non-API-prefixed routes
   - Ensured session routes properly utilize the enhanced Session model
   - Enhanced GET /sessions/:sessionId endpoint to forcefully sync tracks with sequences
   - Added better debugging and logging to identify synchronization issues

## Files Modified

1. `src/server/server.js` - Fixed port configuration
2. `src/server/models/session.js` - Enhanced to properly synchronize tracks and sequences
3. `src/server/app.js` - Updated API endpoints for pattern generation
4. `src/server/routes/sessionRoutes.js` - Simplified to use enhanced Session model

## Key Changes - Latest Fixes

Most recently, we identified that there was an issue with session objects not retaining their prototype methods when retrieved from storage. We fixed this by:

1. Updating `Session.findById` to ensure the sessions returned have all of the prototype methods:
   ```javascript
   static async findById(id) {
     const sessionData = sessions.get(id);
     if (!sessionData) return null;
     
     // If it's already a Session instance, return it directly
     if (sessionData instanceof Session) {
       return sessionData;
     }
     
     // Otherwise, wrap it in a new Session instance
     return new Session(sessionData);
   }
   ```

2. Enhancing session endpoint to forcefully sync tracks with sequences:
   ```javascript
   // CRITICAL: Ensure tracks are synchronized with sequence notes
   if (session.sequences && session.currentSequenceId) {
     const currentSequence = session.sequences[session.currentSequenceId];
     
     if (currentSequence.notes && currentSequence.notes.length > 0) {
       session._syncTrackWithSequence(currentSequence);
     }
   }
   ```

3. Adding debug logging to track synchronization issues

## How to Test

1. Start the server with `npm run dev`
2. Verify that the server starts on port 3003
3. Use the web interface at http://localhost:3003
4. Create a new session
5. Generate patterns (chord progression, bassline, drums)
6. Verify notes appear on the piano roll
7. Test playback

## Rollback

If needed, use the provided rollback script:

```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x scripts/rollback-fixes.sh

# Run the script
./scripts/rollback-fixes.sh
```

This will create a backup branch with the current state and reset the `feature/project-structure` branch to its state before these changes.

## Known Limitations

- Some advanced features like MIDI export might need additional testing
- The import/export functionality has been maintained but could benefit from more thorough testing
