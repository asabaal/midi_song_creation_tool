# MIDI Song Creation Tool - Functionality Fix Notes

## Overview of Changes

This document outlines the changes made to restore functionality in the project structure reorganization. 
The main issues were related to session handling, track/sequence synchronization, and API endpoint behavior.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Port Configuration**
   - Fixed the server port to consistently use 3003 as in the original code
   - Updated `src/server/server.js` to ensure the correct port configuration

2. **Session Handling & Track Synchronization**
   - Enhanced the Session model to properly synchronize between sequences and tracks
   - Added `_syncTrackWithSequence` helper method to ensure notes are properly reflected in UI
   - Updated all Session methods to maintain this synchronization automatically

3. **Pattern Generation**
   - Fixed pattern generation to properly set channel values for proper UI display
   - Ensured bassline notes use channel 1 and drum notes use channel 9
   - Updated track metadata to correctly identify instrument types

4. **API Endpoint Consistency**
   - Fixed API endpoints to ensure consistent behavior between API-prefixed and non-API-prefixed routes
   - Ensured session routes properly utilize the enhanced Session model
   - Simplified sequence creation to use the model's methods

## Files Modified

1. `src/server/server.js` - Fixed port configuration
2. `src/server/models/session.js` - Enhanced to properly synchronize tracks and sequences
3. `src/server/app.js` - Updated API endpoints for pattern generation
4. `src/server/routes/sessionRoutes.js` - Simplified to use enhanced Session model

## How to Test

1. Start the server with `npm run dev`
2. Verify that the server starts on port 3003
3. Use the web interface at http://localhost:3003
4. Create a new session
5. Generate patterns (chord progression, bassline, drums)
6. Verify notes appear on the piano roll
7. Test playback

## Rollback

If needed, use the provided rollback script:

```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x scripts/rollback-fixes.sh

# Run the script
./scripts/rollback-fixes.sh
```

This will create a backup branch with the current state and reset the `feature/project-structure` branch to its state before these changes.

## Known Limitations

- Some advanced features like MIDI export might need additional testing
- The import/export functionality has been maintained but could benefit from more thorough testing
