# Merge Strategy: Testing Suite to Develop Branch

This document outlines the strategy for merging the `feature/testing-suite` branch to the `develop` branch.

## Overview

The `feature/testing-suite` branch contains a comprehensive testing infrastructure, including:

1. Unit tests
2. Integration tests
3. End-to-end tests
4. CI/CD configuration
5. Code quality tools
6. Project structure reorganization

Merging these changes to the `develop` branch requires careful planning to avoid disruption to the existing functionality.

## Pre-Merge Checklist

Before proceeding with the merge, ensure:

- [x] All tests in the `feature/testing-suite` branch are passing
- [x] CI/CD workflows have been tested
- [x] Code quality checks pass
- [x] Documentation has been updated

## Merge Process

### Step 1: Create a Backup

```bash
# Create a backup branch from develop
git checkout develop
git checkout -b develop-backup
git push origin develop-backup
```

### Step 2: File Structure Migration

Since the project structure has been reorganized (moving from flat files to a proper directory structure), we'll need to:

1. Ensure all original functionality has been preserved in the new structure
2. Map old files to their new locations
3. Update imports and references

File mapping:
- `midi-api.js` → `src/server/api/midiApi.js`
- `midi-framework.js` → `src/core/midiSequence.js` + `src/core/patternGenerator.js`
- `midi-exporter.js` → `src/core/midiExport.js`
- `fixed-patterns.js` → `src/core/patterns/fixedPatterns.js`

### Step 3: Testing Preparation

Before merging, ensure the develop branch is ready for the new testing infrastructure:

```bash
# Install testing dependencies on develop
git checkout develop
npm install --save-dev jest cypress @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom supertest cross-env eslint prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-jest
```

### Step 4: Merge Strategy

Due to significant structural changes, we'll use a **squash merge** approach:

```bash
# Create a new integration branch
git checkout -b integration/testing-develop

# Merge testing-suite into integration branch
git merge --squash feature/testing-suite

# Resolve conflicts carefully, preserving functionality
# Test thoroughly after conflict resolution

# Once verified, push integration branch
git push origin integration/testing-develop

# Create a Pull Request from integration/testing-develop to develop
# Have team members review the PR before merging
```

### Step 5: Post-Merge Verification

After merging to develop:

1. Run all tests to verify they pass
2. Manually test key application functionality
3. Verify CI/CD pipelines run successfully
4. Deploy to a staging environment for further testing

## Breaking Changes

The following breaking changes should be noted:

1. **Entry Point Change**: The main entry point has changed from `midi-api.js` to `src/server/server.js`
2. **Script Commands**: New npm scripts replace the old ones
3. **Import Paths**: All import paths have changed due to restructuring
4. **Configuration Files**: New configuration files have been added (.eslintrc, jest.config.js, etc.)

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are discovered after merging:

1. Revert the merge commit
2. Restore from the `develop-backup` branch
3. Address issues in the feature branch and attempt the merge again

## Post-Merge Cleanup

After successful merge and verification:

1. Update documentation to reflect new testing procedures
2. Train team members on the new testing framework
3. Set up code coverage goals
4. Consider removing the backup branch if no issues arise
