## Final Cleanup

After all three PRs are merged, you can delete the original branch:

```bash
# Delete the branch locally
git branch -d feature/testing-suite

# Delete the branch on GitHub
git push origin --delete feature/testing-suite
```

## Troubleshooting

### Merge Conflicts

If you encounter merge conflicts when pulling from develop into the branch, here's how to resolve them:

1. After pulling, check which files have conflicts:
```bash
git status
```

2. Open each conflicting file and look for the conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).

3. Edit the files to resolve the conflicts, keeping the changes that make sense for that specific PR.

4. After editing, mark the conflicts as resolved:
```bash
git add [file-with-resolved-conflict]
```

5. Continue with the merge:
```bash
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
```

### Missing Files

If you're missing expected files in a branch after checkout:

1. Make sure you have the latest version:
```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout feature/[branch-name]
git pull origin feature/[branch-name]
```

### Other Issues

If you encounter any other issues during this process, don't hesitate to reach out for help.
