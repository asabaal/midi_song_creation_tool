# Testing Suite Fixes

This document describes the changes made to fix the failing tests in the MIDI Song Creation Tool.

## Issues Fixed

1. **SessionContext Provider Issues**
   - Fixed the import path in test files (changed `'../../../../src/client/context/SessionContext'` to `'../../../../src/client/contexts/SessionContext'`)
   - Created proper mock implementation for SessionContext in tests/__mocks__/ directory
   - The mock now provides default values for components to use during tests

2. **Music Theory API Endpoint Implementation**
   - Added implementation for the music theory API endpoints in src/server/api/musicTheory.js
   - Added proper support for sharp keys (F#) and enharmonic equivalents
   - Created test setup for API integration tests

3. **Component Export Issues**
   - Fixed path issues in the import statements
   - Ensured proper module exports for tests

## Expected Results

These changes should fix the following test failures:

1. SessionContext errors in PianoRoll and TransportControls components
2. Missing updateTransport function calls in tests
3. Undefined PianoRoll component issues
4. 404 errors for music theory API endpoints with F# and enharmonic equivalents

## How to Verify

Run the test suite with:

```bash
npm test
```

Or for specific tests:

```bash
# For component tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern=client/components

# For API tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern=api
```

The filter-test-results.sh script can be used to generate a clean report of the test results.
