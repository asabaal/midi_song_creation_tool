# Testing Suite Backups

This directory contains backups of the testing infrastructure files that have been removed from the `feature/project-structure` branch. These files should be added in the subsequent `feature/testing-suite-only` branch.

The testing suite includes:

1. Test configuration files:
   - jest.config.js
   - jest.setup.js
   - cypress.config.js

2. Test directories:
   - /tests (entire directory)
   - /test-results (entire directory)

3. Documentation:
   - docs/TESTING.md

These files were backed up to maintain their content while keeping the `feature/project-structure` branch focused solely on project structure reorganization.
