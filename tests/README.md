# Test Directory Placeholder

This directory is a placeholder for the testing infrastructure that will be added in the `feature/testing-suite-only` branch.

The test files have been backed up in `.testing-backup/` for preservation.

## Directory Structure

The following directories should be considered empty for now:

- `tests/e2e/` - Will contain end-to-end tests
- `tests/fixtures/` - Will contain test fixtures
- `tests/integration/` - Will contain integration tests
- `tests/mocks/` - Will contain test mocks
- `tests/unit/` - Will contain unit tests
