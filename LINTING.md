# Linting and Testing Configuration

This document explains the setup and fixes applied to resolve linting and testing issues in the MIDI Song Creation Tool.

## ESLint Configuration

An `.eslintrc` file has been added with rules to:

1. Turn off `no-console` warnings in server code
2. Turn off `react/prop-types` checks in test files
3. Set appropriate environments (node, browser, es2021, jest)

## Prettier Configuration

A `.prettierrc` file has been added with consistent formatting rules:

```json
{
  "singleQuote": true,
  "trailingComma": "es5",
  "printWidth": 100,
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "semi": true,
  "arrowParens": "avoid",
  "endOfLine": "lf"
}
```

## Fixed Issues

The following issues have been fixed:

1. **Unused Variables**:
   - Removed unused `rootPitch` and `rootPitchBase` variables in `patternGenerator.js`

2. **Console Statements**:
   - Added `eslint-disable-next-line no-console` comments to console statements in core modules
   - Configured ESLint to allow console statements in server code

3. **Prettier/Whitespace Issues**:
   - Fixed indentation and trailing whitespace in `midiExport.js` and `musicTheory.js`
   - Added script `/scripts/fix_prettier.sh` to directly fix Prettier formatting issues

4. **Test Dependencies**:
   - Added `prop-types` dependency for React components
   - Created missing files needed by React component tests:
     - `src/client/services/transportService.js`
     - `src/client/services/apiService.js`
     - `src/client/context/SessionContext.js`

5. **Test Logic Fixes**:
   - Fixed chord progression logic in `musicTheory.js` so that the test for A minor progressions passes
   - Fixed MIDI export error handling to throw errors correctly for invalid paths
   - Fixed MIDI buffer creation to include track headers for proper track counting

## Running Linting Checks

Run the following command to run ESLint with automatic fixes where possible:

```bash
npx eslint --fix src/
```

Or use the test script:

```bash
./scripts/local_test.sh
```

## Next Steps

1. Consider replacing console statements with a proper logging system
2. Add more comprehensive test coverage 
3. Standardize error handling patterns across the codebase
